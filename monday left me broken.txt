Based on a quick look at the filenames and contents, here is what each of the attached notebooks is doing:

**Date Format Conversion.ipynb:**

- Reads in a CSV file with a date column in mmddyyyy format
- Converts the date to a new column in dd/mm/yyyy format using Spark date functions
- Writes the result out to a CSV file

This shows a simple transformation on a date column.

**De-Duplication.ipynb:**

- Reads a CSV file with duplicate rows 
- Loads into a Spark DataFrame and de-duplicates it by selecting distinct rows
- Shows an example of removing duplicate rows

**exercise.ipynb:**

- Reads two input CSV files as DataFrames
- Joins the DataFrames together on a common key column 
- Applies some transformations like converting to uppercase
- Displays and saves the result 

This shows a simple join and transformation pipeline.

**Simple ETL Process.ipynb:**

- Full example of an ETL process - read data, create database/tables, transform data, join tables, save result
- Covers the main steps like extract, transform, load

Shows end-to-end ETL workflow with Spark.

Overall these demonstrate some common Spark data transformation tasks like cleaning, joining, converting formats etc that are part of ETL pipelines. Let me know if any part needs more explanation!
